Hey there! My name is Adelina, but amongst my friends, I am often called one of the many nicknames I have. Just to give you a sense of what I mean by many, my nicknames include Adel, Adol, Addition, Adelania, Addy, Adellybean, Adelama—the list goes on.

My interests range from Computer Science to Business to Dance, and recently, I've found a growing interest in Physics.

As most of my friends know, I enjoy reading non-fiction books. And more specifically, textbooks. Currently, I am reading *[College Physics](https://www.amazon.com/College-Physics-Raymond-Serway/dp/1285737024/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1NXR9N47Z3T7B&dchild=1&keywords=college+physics+serway&qid=1626299579&sprefix=college+physics+s%2Caps%2C240&sr=8-4)*. As mind-boggling and overwhelming as it is, I will admit it is interesting. Textbooks aside, other non-fiction books that I have found to be very informative and interesting include *[How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/8189297813/ref=sr_1_4?crid=11E1R6U3NCKX7&dchild=1&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people+dale+carnegie&qid=1626298864&sprefix=how+to+win+friends%2Caps%2C262&sr=8-4)* and *[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1982137274/ref=sr_1_3?crid=481ZIA9F1WT8&dchild=1&keywords=the+7+habits+of+highly+effective+people&qid=1626298905&sprefix=the+7+hab%2Caps%2C249&sr=8-3)*. Now to the fiction gems. Whenever I read a fiction novel, I tend to think through all the possible plot twists and endings, so it is rare that I come across one where the plot and ending is unpredictable. Finding a book that has passed my "predictability test" is very exciting. A few of those rare books include *[Ender's Game](https://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-Ender-Quintet-1/dp/1250773024/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1626299287&sr=8-1)* and *[To Kill a Mockingbird](https://www.amazon.com/Kill-Mockingbird-Harper-Lee/dp/0060935464/ref=sr_1_1?crid=15ALP55GZ86LY&dchild=1&keywords=to+kill+a+mockingbird+book&qid=1626299326&sprefix=to+kill+a+mocking%2Caps%2C254&sr=8-1)*. For now, that's about it for my book recommendations.

When I am not busy doing work (or reading textbooks), I often find myself on Youtube going down rabbit holes, some that are definetely more educational than others. One time, despite not even have taken a calculus class, I was dragged into a calculus hole thanks to 3Blue1Brown's *[Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x)* series. Another time, it was a quantum computing hole after becoming completely puzzled by Tanay's lecture on phase kickback. Lastly, probably one of the more notable instances would be that particle physics hole I dove into after watching *[The Elegant Universe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/the-elegant-universe/)*.

At this point, you're probably thinking, "Bruh, get a life", but trust me, I do have a life—or atleast one that fits my definition of a life.

Remember how I said some rabbit holes I go down are definitely more educational than others? Well, I'll let you decide this for yourself. The K-pop and C-pop hole is one of the strongest holes I can be sucked down. The only stronger hole is probably a blackhole. When I am not in a specific Youtube hole, I enjoy watching baking/cooking and dance videos.

If you didn't get the hint already, I listen to lots and lots of K-pop and C-pop, thanks to my wonderful friend Tanay. My favorite singer is Eric Chou. His songs are amazing. For starters, I recommend you listen to *[小时候的我们](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxsOcRm3dsU)*, *[怎么了](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2ge3KrdeWs)*，*[你好不好](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSBXfzgqHtE)*, *[爱我的时候](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG563p_moiE)*, and *[Rollercoasters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9GRmPeMr5c)*. As for K-pop, I enjoy listening to Twice, Itzy, BTS, Red Velvet, IU, and Taeyeon. If you ever need a song recommendation, do not hesistate to reach out!

Unfortunately, I do not have any movie recommendations, since I am not the biggest fan of movies. However, I do watch C-drama. A few that I enjoyed watching include《爱情进化论》and《致我们单纯的小美好》.

With that, I hope you enjoy reading my other blogs!
