      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard the term quantum computing thrown around more lately.
But, what&amp;rsquo;s with all the hype around quantum computing?
Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanicsal phenomena to perform computation, so before we go into the nitty gritty details of all quantum computing has to offer, there&amp;rsquo;s a few fundamental quantum mechanical concepts we need to understand. Let&amp;rsquo;s rewind a few decades and see how all this started:</description>

      <description>The first time I went stargazing was at the age of 15, which is rather late compared to most people. A good reason for this might be thanks to the fact that I live in a pretty big city, hence light pollution is a real big issue.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I love the urban suburban vibe where I live, but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for stargazing. Here, staring up at the sky at even the darkest times of the day only allowed me to see a handful of stars, so growing up, thats how I thought things were–just a few stars here and there randomly scattered across the sky.</description>

      <description>Hey there! My name is Adelina, but amongst my friends, I am often called one of the many nicknames I have. Just to give you a sense of what I mean by many, my nicknames include Adel, Adol, Addition, Adelania, Addy, Adellybean—the list goes on.
My interests range from Computer Science to Business to Dance, and recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a growing interest in Physics.
As most of my friends know, I enjoy reading non-fiction books.</description>
