      <description>The first time I went stargazing was at the age of 15, which is rather late compared to most people. A good reason for this might be thanks to the fact that I live in a pretty big city, hence light pollution is a real big issue.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong. I love the urban suburban vibe where I live, but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal for stargazing. Here, staring up at the sky at even the darkest times of the day only allowed me to see a handful of stars, so growing up, thats how I thought things wereâ€“just a few stars here and there randomly scattered across the sky.</description>
