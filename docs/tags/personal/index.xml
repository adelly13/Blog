      <description>Hey there! My name is Adelina, but amongst my friends, I am often called one of the many nicknames I have. Just to give you a sense of what I mean by many, my nicknames include Adel, Adol, Addition, Adelania, Addy, Adellybean, Adelamaâ€”the list goes on.
My interests range from Computer Science to Business to Dance, and recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a growing interest in Physics.
As most of my friends know, I enjoy reading non-fiction books.</description>
